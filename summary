The 6 layers of the Innovation Stack

Divine Discontent (Jeff Bezos)
- customers are never satisfied
- today's wow becomes tomorrow's ordinary

Exponentials (Ray Kurzweil)
- broad trends will dominate over specific technologies
- exponentials start slow and then blow past everyone's expectations, tapping into customer's infinite appetites

Disruption (Clay Christensen)
- deceptively small new entrants into a market start with a single area where they can beat incumbents
- these entrants scale rapidly, powered by exponentials

3 Horizons (Baghai, Coley, White)
- companies need to continually invest in growth without neglecting existing business
- this means balancing investments across three time horizons: near, medium, and long term

Search vs Execute
- medium and long term innovations are qualitatively different than short term innovations
- the goal is to learn, not execute, which requires a different mindset and toolkit

Pipeline
- to innovate, companies need to source huge amounts of people, technologies, ideas, and problems 
- this influx must be gradually filtered to the most promising opportunities for growth
